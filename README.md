# Building-the-Car-of-the-Future-Linear-Regression

Problem:

A car manufacturer known for making large automobiles is struggling with sales and has asked for your help in designing an energy efficient car. Using data gathered, determine which attributes may contribute to higher gas mileage so that they can design a more fuel efficient automobile.

Part 1:

Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.
   1. Checked for duplicate rows
   2. Handled missing data using imputation techniques
   3. Corrected the datatypes of columns
   4. Checked for outliers
   5. Performed exploratory data analysis
   6. Checked frequency distribution of variables
   7. Checked Summary statistics

Part 2:

Build a linear regression model to accurately predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on the attributes of a vehicle. Discuss the significant attributes and how they can help you build the proper car.
   1. Checked co-relation between variables
   2. Split the dataset into train and test
   3. Scaled the dataset
   4. Performed linear regression
   5. Analyzed summary of model

Part 3:

Optimize the model using selection techniques, explain whether the model can achieve the specified goals, and describe which attributes contribute to higher MPG over others.
   1. Implemented feature selection techniques like Backward Elimination and Forward Selection
   2. Checked whether the model is giving optimized results after implementing feature selection techniques
